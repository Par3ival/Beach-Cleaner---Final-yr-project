# Key project requirements and how they are being met

## Enter and *navigate* the beach area using intelligent route finding
1. ROS mapping will be used to pathfind 
1. Ultrasonic sensors for collision detection

## *Identify* recycling bins from optically coded sensors (at least 3 different types)
1. Camera will take video and python code will process it 

## *Identify different types* of rubbish (you can choose what you want to demonstrate)
1. Machine vision will be trained to ID plastic, metal and paper

## *Identify and characterize* different crab types and the routes taken
1. Machine vision will be used to ID crabs 
1. ROS path finding will use image data to map crab location 

## *Actively avoid* interfering with the crabs
1. ROS pathfindion will map and  set avoid area
1. collision detection will ensure crabs are detected 

## *Identify and alert* operators about other wildlife
1. Segaull will be detected with sensors 
1. Filtering will Id the segull sound
1. light and sound will be used to alert 

## *Identify* waterline and *actively avoid or mitigate* against the incoming tide
1. Water table GPS to track tide
