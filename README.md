# Beach-Cleaner---Final-yr-project

This documents all the work put towards the final year group project (6 People).

I ended up doing all the work towards: machine vision, machine learning, creating neural nets, ROS, inter robot communication techniques, message formats, prototype/final product CAD designs and small scale PCB designs.
The rest of the work was mostly worked on by 3 of my team mates: Oly Pope, Jack White and Stephen Jeranyama. With Leo Garroch contributing to LED sequence detection.

THIS IS A CLONED REPO OF ALL WORK CARRIED OUT.
